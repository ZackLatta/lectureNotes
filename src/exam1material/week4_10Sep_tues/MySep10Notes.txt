HW 3 due tonight - don't add parentheses


p ∨ q ∨ r

    What is the top-level operator?



(p ^ q ^ r) ⊢ (p)

    how many steps would this take?



no new homework this week

Exam 1 is Thursday, September 12

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- Another natural deduction example with OR
- Implies elimination
- Exam 1 review



HW 2 quick discussion:
- check solution for more details on missed problems


p: it is sunny
q: I go hiking

p -> q

"It is sunny, so I go hiking"

Is this correct?
no, the correct translation will be:
"If it is sunny, then I will go hiking"

////////////////////////////////

Proving equivalence.

--> how do we prove two statements are equal in truth tables?






--> how could we prove equivalence with proofs?



////////////////////////////////

Example: prove one of the distributive laws

p ∨ (q ∧ r)     is equivalent to       (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)

Already did on Thursday:

    p ∨ (q ∧ r) ⊢ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)




What is left?




(finish orDist2.sc)


////////////////////////////////

How could we prove two statements are NOT equivalent?

p → q     vs    q → p

Find one truth assignment where the two statements have different outputs

p = F
q = T
First statement would be true, the second is false

////////////////////////////////

Implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P, P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



(This rule is also called "modus ponens")

Example:

//Suppose we know x > 5. What can we conclude?

if (x > 5) {
    y = 17;
}

y = 17

///////////////////////////////

Syntax for using ImplyE:

a ( P       )   by Justification,
b ( P → Q   )   by Justification,
c ( Q       )   by ImplyE(b, a)

(implies: __>:)

////////////////////////////////////////

Example (imply1.logika):

(p ∧ q) → r,  p → q,  p  ⊢ r



Example (imply2.logika):

p → r,  q → r,  p ∨ q  ⊢ r

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point (including today).

See Canvas announcement for list of topics.




How to prove two propositional logic statements are equivalent?

    1: Truth Table for both statement (for every truth assignments, both statements have the same output)
    2: statement 1 |- statement2 and statement 2 |- statement 1 (two natural deduction proofs)


How to prove propositional logic statements are NOT equivalent?

Find one truth assignment that has a different output for the two statements
(can't prove not equivalent wih natural deduction)


What is satisfiability?

A statement is satisfiable if I can find at least one truth assignment that makes its output true

    how prove a statement is satisfiable?
        Just one truth assignment

    how prove a statement is not satisfiable?
        Need full truth table. Show output is false for every truth assignment


- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)
    given a set of premises, see if a conclusion logically follows

    how prove valid?
        Combined truth table with all premises/conclusion

        show any time ALL premises are true then the conclusion is also true (when conclusion is true in other times doesn't matter)

        Approach 2: prove that sequent
        premises |- conclusion
        with natural deduction

    how prove invalid?
    One time where a premise is true and the conclusion is false



/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


All problems will be "open-ended" - similar in content/format
to HW problems.


Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
